- 👋 Hi, I’m @henguel19, I'm from Guatemala, I love software development, because I like solve problems with software based solutions, and I'm CS Student too (I finished my degree, but I have no title)
- 👀 I’m interested in PHP and Java backend Development, mobile development with Android and AI.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android using Java, because I think the phones are the actual and new way that users interact with software most often.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on PHP, Java and JavaScript projects.
